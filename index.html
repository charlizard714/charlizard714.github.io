        <h2>About India</h2>
        
        <p id="about-india">India is a great place to go because there are famous places and great foods to try. There are different types of games and toys to try out while you are at this place. There are also many competitions to participate in, too.</p>
        
        <h2>The Taj Mahal</h2>
        
        <p>I am going to talk about the Taj Mahal because this is a special place here. The Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders in the world has wonders, but beware, there are also curses in here too.</p>
        
        <p>We celebrate Diwali, to scare the evil spirits, so we make fireworks to scare them.</p>
